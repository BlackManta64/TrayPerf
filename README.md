`Python` `sys` `PySide6` `psutil` `GPUtil`

> [!CAUTION]
> This software may be falsely detected as a Trojan (Trojan:Script/Wacatac.B!ml) by some antivirus programs, such as Windows Defender.
> 
> **Why this happens:**  
> TrayPerf reads system information (CPU, RAM, GPU) and is packaged as a self-contained executable (`--onefile`), which can resemble malware behavior to antivirus software. This is a **false positive**, and the software is safe to use.
### âœ… How to Avoid False Detection

1. **Use the recommended build options:**  
```pyinstaller --onedir --noupx main.py```
